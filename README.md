# scDBic

**scDBic: A novel deep learning-based biclustering algorithm for analyzing scRNA-seq data**

scDBic is a R+Python package for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) biclustering analysis. It integrates dimensionality reduction and graph-based biclustering in a unified deep learning framework. It outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and biological interpretability.
